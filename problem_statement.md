# Problem Statement: Sales Insights Dashboard for Atliq Hardware

Atliq Hardware, a growing B2B electronics manufacturer, faces significant challenges in analyzing and optimizing its sales performance across multiple regions and product categories. 
The company generates vast amounts of sales data, but without a structured approach to analysis, identifying key trends, tracking revenue growth, and making data-driven decisions remains a challenge.

Key problems include:
- Fragmented and unstructured sales data, making it difficult to derive meaningful insights.
-	Lack of visibility into regional and product-level sales trends, affecting inventory and marketing strategies.
-	Difficulty in tracking key performance indicators (KPIs) such as revenue, profit margins, and customer segmentation.
-	Inability to perform dynamic analysis on high-performing and underperforming products or regions.
  
To address these challenges, this project aims to build an interactive Sales Insights Dashboard in Power BI that will:
-	Clean and transform Atliq Hardwareâ€™s sales data for better accuracy and usability.
-	Visualize key sales KPIs like total revenue, profit margins, and customer trends.
-	Implement advanced segmentation and trend analysis, enabling data-driven decision-making.
-	Provide interactive filters and drill-through features for deeper insights.
-	Deliver actionable insights to optimize sales performance, pricing strategies, and resource allocation.
  
This dashboard will empower Atliq Hardware to make informed business decisions, identify growth opportunities, and improve overall sales performance.
